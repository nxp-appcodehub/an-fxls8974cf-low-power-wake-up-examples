Example Brief:
===================
This ISSDK FXLS8974CF example demonstrates SDCD configuration for tap-motion detection wake-up and enabling
auto-wake/sleep (AWS) feature to autonomously transition sensor to sleep mode on expiry of ASLP counter.

Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/micro C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- FRDM-STBI-A8974 board (https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/eb-hub/product/frdm-stbi-a8974)
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
Since the examples use I2C, Pins 2-3 of SW2 on FRDM-STBI-A8974 should be connected.
Connect pins 1-2 on jumpers J7 and J8 to select I2C0 on FRDM-STBI-A8974 shield board.
SW1 Pins 2-3 should be connected to select default operating mode i.e. "ACCEL NORMAL" mode.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
===============
Shake the board up and down 2-3 times to detect shake motion event.
When the demo runs successfully, you can see the Samples printed to the terminal.
